A real-time searchable Pashto glossary

Jan. 8th, 2025 @ 9:39 PM: 
The idea is to create a Pashto glossary of primarily native terms with the ability to search for them using a real-time search engine.
Using MongoDB, we can allow the user to search for them. Currently, the intention is to have an interface that includes common Hindustani, Arabic or Persian terms that are used in place of the native terms.
